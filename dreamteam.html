      <p>Working on My Imperial Campus App projects.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card-bg">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The My Imperial Campus App is being developed as a one-stop hub for student life, making it easier to access services, resources, and information across campus. It’s part of a broader initiative to improve the student experience through innovative digital tools.</p>
      <p> As part of the My Imperial Campus App, I designed a Graduation feature aimed at improving the student experience during one of the most significant milestones at Imperial College London. The feature was developed to simplify the process, reduce stress, and create a more memorable and engaging graduation journey.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Graduation should be an exciting milestone — but for Imperial students, the process felt confusing and fragmented:</p>
    <ul class="meta">
      <li>💌 Students received up to 15 separate emails, making it easy to miss key information.</li>
      <li>🌐 Details were scattered across websites and documents, leading to uncertainty.</li>
      <li>⏰ There was no clear timeline or checklist for tasks and deadlines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, what should have been a celebration often became stressful and overwhelming.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To understand students’ real experiences, I conducted a multi-method research study:</p>

      <div class="project-image">
        <img src="images/gradresearch.png" alt="Project">
      </div>

      <p><strong>🎓 Interviews:</strong> Spoke with 3 students (Master’s and undergraduates) about their graduation planning challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>📱 Observational Research:</strong> Analyzed graduation vlogs and TikToks to uncover common frustrations and emotional moments.</p>
      <p><strong>🏫 Benchmark Analysis:</strong> Reviewed other universities’ graduation tools to identify best practices and innovation gaps.</p>

      <p><strong>Key insights included:</p></strong>

      <ul class="research">
        <li>💡 Students felt overwhelmed by the volume of information and the lack of a clear, consolidated source.</li>
        <li>💡 There was a strong desire for a personalized experience that could guide them through the process step-by-step.</li>
        <li>💡 Students valued social features that allowed them to share their experiences and connect with peers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="userpersonas">
      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>Based on research, I developed three user personas representing different student types:</p>
    <div class="carousel">
        <button class="carousel-btn prev">&#10094;</button>
  
        <div class="carousel-track">
          <img src="images/graduser1.png" alt="User 1">
          <img src="images/graduser2.png" alt="User 2">
          <img src="images/graduser3.png" alt="User 3">
        </div>
  
        <button class="carousel-btn next">&#10095;</button>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>To address these needs, I designed the Graduation Feature within the My Imperial Campus App, transforming the entire graduation process into a centralized, stress-free experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
      <ul class="meta">

        <li><strong>📅 Interactive Timeline:</strong> A visual timeline that outlines key milestones leading up to graduation, helping students stay on track.</li>
        <li><strong>💬 Social Sharing:</strong> Features that allow students to share their graduation journey with friends and family, fostering a sense of community.</li>
        <li><strong>🔔 Notifications & Reminders:</strong> Push notifications to remind students of upcoming deadlines and important events.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 1 – Pre-Graduation (2–3 months before)</h2>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design. Centralizing information and guiding students step-by-step reduced stress and made graduation more enjoyable. Combining practical tools (checklists, notifications) with inspirational features (outfit boards, photo spots) balanced functionality with delight.</p>
      <p>I strengthened my skills across UX research, UI design, and visual identity, and learned how thoughtful digital design can transform high-stakes experiences into memorable ones.</p>
