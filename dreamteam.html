      <h2>Graduation Feature - My Imperial Campus App</h2>
      <p>The My Imperial Campus App is being developed as a one-stop hub for student life, making it easier to access services, resources, and information across campus. It’s part of a broader initiative to improve the student experience through innovative digital tools.</p>
      <p> As part of the My Imperial Campus App, I designed a Graduation feature aimed at improving the student experience during one of the most significant milestones at Imperial College London. The feature was developed to simplify the process, reduce stress, and create a more memorable and engaging graduation journey.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Graduation is a major event, but the existing process created unnecessary challenges for students:</p>
    <ul class="meta">
      <li>Up to <strong>15 separate emails</strong> were sent, making it easy for students to lose track of crucial information.</li>
      <li><strong>Key details</strong> were scattered across emails, the university website, and other sources, leading to confusion.</li>
      <li>There was <strong>no clear timeline</strong> of required tasks, leaving students uncertain about deadlines and responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This fragmented approach made what should be an exciting experience feel overwhelming and frustrating.</p>
</section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To better understand students’ needs and experiences around graduation, I conducted a multi-faceted research approach.</p>

      <div class="project-image">
        <img src="images/gradresearch.png" alt="Project">
      </div>

      <p><strong>Interviews:</strong> Conducted interviews with 3 students from various years, including Master’s graduates and current 3rd-year students, to gather insights into their expectations, challenges, and experiences related to graduation.</p>
      <p><strong>Observational Research:</strong> Reviewed graduation vlogs and TikToks to observe real-life student experiences, identify common pain points, and understand the emotional and social context of graduation.</p>
      <p><strong>Benchmark Analysis:</strong> Researched graduation-focused apps from other universities to identify successful features, workflows, and areas for improvement.</p>

      <p> Key insights included:</p>

      <ul class="research">
        <li>Students felt overwhelmed by the volume of information and the lack of a clear, consolidated source.</li>
        <li>There was a strong desire for a personalized experience that could guide them through the process step-by-step.</li>
        <li>Students valued social features that allowed them to share their experiences and connect with peers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>The Graduation feature was designed to have the following core features:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>Centralize Information:</strong> All graduation-related information, tasks, and deadlines are consolidated in one place within the My Imperial Campus App.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Task List:</strong> A dynamic task list that updates based on the student’s progress, ensuring they know exactly what to do and when.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Timeline:</strong> A visual timeline that outlines key milestones leading up to graduation, helping students stay on track.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Sharing:</strong> Features that allow students to share their graduation journey with friends and family, fostering a sense of community.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications & Reminders:</strong> Push notifications to remind students of upcoming deadlines and important events.</li>
      </ul>
