      <h2>Scentinel</h2>
      <p> Scentinel is a smart scent diffuser designed to help beekeepers protect hives from pests and environmental stressors. Using targeted bursts of essential oils, it deters wasps and calms bees in a non-invasive way. The product combines physical design, digital interaction, and a clear visual identity into a single user-centered solution. 
      <p> Note: This project included visual branding inspired by WWF to align with a sustainability brief, but was not developed in collaboration with or endorsed by WWF.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Urban beekeepers face challenges when protecting their colonies from pests such as wasps, hornets and mice. These threats contribute to hive stress, reduced honey production, and colony collapse. Traditional solutions are often invasive, unreliable, or unethical, with limited options that are sustainable, preventative and compatible with small-scale urban setups.</p>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To ground the design in real needs, I explored the beekeeper community and industry context through:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Broad surveys and focused interviews with beekeepers at all levels (recreational to expert).</li>
        <li><strong>Field Visits:</strong> On-site observation with Bee Urban (a social enterprise in Kennington focused on environmental protection and urban beekeeping).</li>
        <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Review of current hive-protection products to uncover gaps and opportunities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Guiding design question:</p>
      <p>How might we effectively monitor and manage hive conditions to ensure colony health, protection, and adaptability to environmental changes?</p>
