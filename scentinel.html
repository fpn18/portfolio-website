      <p>DESIRE award Winning Project</p>

    <section class="card-bg">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Scentinel is a smart scent diffuser designed to help beekeepers protect hives from pests and environmental stressors. Using targeted bursts of natural essential oils, it deters wasps and calms bees in a gentle, non-invasive way. The project brings together physical design, digital interaction, and visual identity into one cohesive, user-centered solution.</p>
      <p><i>Note: This project included visual branding inspired by WWF to align with a sustainability brief, but was not developed in collaboration with or endorsed by WWF.</i></p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Urban beekeepers struggle to protect their colonies from pests such as wasps, hornets, and mice. These threats increase hive stress, reduce honey production, and can even lead to colony collapse.</p>
      <p>Existing solutions are often invasive, unreliable, or unsustainable, with limited options suitable for small-scale urban setups.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To ground the design in real needs, we explored the beekeeper community and industry context through:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>👥 User Research:</strong> Surveys and interviews with beekeepers from hobbyists to professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>🏙️ Field Visits:</strong> On-site observation with Bee Urban (a social enterprise in Kennington focused on environmental protection and urban beekeeping).</li>
        <li><strong>📊 Market Analysis:</strong> Reviewed existing hive-protection products to identify key gaps and opportunities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>🎯 Guiding design question:</p></strong>
      <p><i>How might we effectively monitor and manage hive conditions to ensure colony health, protection, and adaptability to environmental changes?</p></i>

    <section class="ideation">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>As a team of four, each member developed their own initial sketches and concepts based on the project brief and user insights. We then presented and discussed these ideas collectively, evaluating them against the design requirements and feedback from stakeholders.
      Through this collaborative process, we identified the most promising direction — a smart, scent-based solution for hive protection — which evolved into Scentinel. The final concept combined the strongest elements from each team member’s ideas, balancing innovation, feasibility, and user value.

    <section class="prototyping">
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>We developed a series of prototypes to test and refine the Scentinel concept, focusing on both physical and digital aspects. Initial low-fidelity models helped us explore form factors, usability, and scent diffusion mechanisms. We then progressed to high-fidelity prototypes that incorporated functional electronics and a companion app interface.</p>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Scentinel is a discreet, hive-mounted diffuser system that uses sound detection and natural essential oils to respond to threats.</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>🧠 Smart Sensing:</strong> Detects hive distress sounds and identifies potential threats such as wasp attacks or hive disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>🌸 Targeted Action:</strong> Automatically releases specific blends of essential oils to deter pests or calm the colony.</li>
        <li><strong>📱 User-Friendly Interface:</strong> A companion app visualizes hive health and sends alerts when beekeeper intervention is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>🌎 Sustainable Design:</strong> Made from eco-friendly materials, aligning with ethical and responsible beekeeping principles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By combining smart sensing, natural deterrence, and digital feedback, Scentinel empowers beekeepers to act proactively and sustainably—without disturbing the colony.</p>
