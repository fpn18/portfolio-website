      <p>A global food box to educate healthy eating to families.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Good nutrition is essential for children’s development — but families often lack accessible food education. Children rarely experience foods beyond their own culture, limiting both their dietary variety and cultural understanding. The challenge: Reimagine food experiences to promote health, well-being, and inclusivity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To understand the issue, I conducted interviews, school visits, and diary studies:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>👩‍🏫 Teachers shared how peers and parents shape children’s diets.</li>
        <li>👩‍👧 Parents and children discussed eating habits and lifestyle challenges.</li>
        <li>🏫 School visits revealed how dining environments influence behaviour.</li>
        <li>📔 A 7-day diary explored social media’s impact on food choices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>👩‍👧 Parents are role models:</strong> Children mirror their parents’ eating habits; unhealthy choices at home affect children’s diet and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>📚 Limited parental resources:</strong> Few accessible tools exist for meal planning, understanding food labels, or affordable healthy options.</li>
        <li><strong>🏫 School vs. home gap:</strong> Schools enforce healthy eating, but at-home habits often undo progress; stronger parent-school collaboration is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>📱 Social influence:</strong> Social media trends and peer pressure drive children toward unhealthy snacks.</li>
        <li><strong>🍫 Convenience & rewards:</strong> Sugary or quick-prep foods are used as rewards and consumed more during boredom or inactivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="ideation">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>From these insights, we asked:</p>
      <p><strong>💭 How might we make nutrition education a co-learning experience for families with young children?</strong></p>
      <p>I generated 15 initial ideas in response to this question — ranging from physical experiences to digital tools. Recognising that not all families have equal access to technology, I explored both directions but chose to prioritise physical concepts to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all families.</p>
