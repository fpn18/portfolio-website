    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Good nutrition is essential for children’s development — but families often lack accessible, engaging food education. Children rarely experience foods beyond their own culture, limiting dietary variety and cultural curiosity </p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</p></strong>
      <p>Reimagine food experiences to promote health, well-being, and inclusivity through shared family activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To understand the issue, we conducted interviews, school visits, and diary studies:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>👩‍🏫 Teachers shared how peers and parents shape children’s diets.</li>
        <li>👩‍👧 Parents and children discussed eating habits and lifestyle challenges.</li>
        <li>🏫 School visits revealed how dining environments influence behaviour.</li>
        <li>📔 A 7-day diary explored social media’s impact on food choices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>👩‍👧 Parents are role models:</strong> Children mirror their parents’ eating habits; unhealthy choices at home affect children’s diet and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>📚 Limited parental resources:</strong> Few accessible tools exist for meal planning, understanding food labels, or affordable healthy options.</li>
        <li><strong>🏫 School vs. home gap:</strong> Schools enforce healthy eating, but at-home habits often undo progress; stronger parent-school collaboration is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>📱 Social influence:</strong> Social media trends and peer pressure drive children toward unhealthy snacks.</li>
        <li><strong>🍫 Convenience & rewards:</strong> Sugary or quick-prep foods are used as rewards and consumed more during boredom or inactivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="ideation">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>From these insights, we asked:</p>
      <p><strong>💭 How might we make nutrition education a co-learning experience for families with young children?</strong></p>
      <p>I generated 15 initial concepts, ranging from digital tools to physical experiences. To ensure accessibility and inclusivity, the final direction prioritized physical experiences that any family could enjoy — regardless of their access to technology.</p>

    <section class="prototyping">
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Through iterative design, I developed a prototype that combined education, play, and exploration in one seamless experience. Early concept testing with families helped refine the box’s structure, balance educational content with fun, and ensure age-appropriate engagement for children.</p>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Taste Together is a monthly food subscription service designed for families to explore, cook, and learn together.</p>
      <p>Each box includes:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>🥗 All ingredients needed to prepare 3 meals for a family of 4, inspired by the cuisine of the featured country.</li>
        <li>🎲 A family board game that encourages interactive learning and play.</li>
        <li>🌍 A collectible passport where children can add a new stamp each month, tracking their culinary journey.</li>
        <li>📖 A storybook set in the featured country, bringing culture and traditions to life.</li>
        <li>📱 QR code linking to an interactive app for additional educational content and engagement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interactive App Design</h2>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project deepened my understanding of how design can shape everyday family habits through empathy and storytelling. I learned to balance education with engagement, using play and cultural exploration to make healthy eating fun rather than instructional.</p>
      <p>It strengthened my skills in user research, service design, and brand storytelling, and reminded me that meaningful design often begins at the dinner table — where learning, culture, and connection naturally come together.</p>
