      <h1>Taste Together</h1>
      <p>A global food box to educate healthy eating to families.</p>

    <section class="card-bg">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Taste Together is a monthly food subscription box that encourages families to explore global cuisines while learning about nutrition and culture together. It transforms cooking into a fun co-learning experience, promoting healthy eating habits and cross-cultural understanding through storytelling, recipes, and shared discovery at home</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Good nutrition is essential for children’s development — but families often lack accessible food education. Children rarely experience foods beyond their own culture, limiting both their dietary variety and cultural understanding. The challenge: Reimagine food experiences to promote health, well-being, and inclusivity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To understand the issue, I conducted interviews, school visits, and diary studies:</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>👩‍🏫 Teachers shared how peers and parents shape children’s diets.</li>
        <li>👩‍👧 Parents and children discussed eating habits and lifestyle challenges.</li>
        <li>🏫 School visits revealed how dining environments influence behaviour.</li>
        <li>📔 A 7-day diary explored social media’s impact on food choices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>

      <p>👩‍👧 1. Parents as Role Models</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>Children mirror their parents’ eating habits — both positive and negative.</li>
        <li>Unhealthy parental choices create an intergenerational cycle of poor nutrition.</li>
        <li>Parents who regularly consume unhealthy foods influence children’s taste preferences early on.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>📚 2. Lack of Parental Nutrition Resources</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>There are limited accessible resources for parents to learn about nutrition.</li>
        <li>Topics such as meal planning, reading food labels, and affordable healthy options are often missing.</li>
        <li>Workshops exist in some schools, but there’s no consistent or trusted platform for parents to turn to.</li>
      <ul>

      <p>🏫 3. School vs. Home Disconnect</p>
      <ul class="meta">
      <li>Schools enforce healthy eating rules (fruit-only snacks, lunchtime monitoring), but at-home habits often undo this progress.</li>
      <li>Stronger collaboration between parents and schools could help build consistent nutrition habits across both environments.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>📱 4. Social Media & Peer Influence</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>Platforms like TikTok drive snack trends (e.g., Takis, Prime drinks) that are viewed as “cool” but have low nutritional value.</li>
        <li>Peer pressure around food choices is increasing, especially in older children (ages 10–11).</li>
      <ul>

      <p>🍫 5. Emotional & Convenience Eating</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>Parents often use sugary foods as rewards for good behaviour.</li>
        <li>Children tend to overeat when bored or inactive, especially choosing convenient snacks that require no preparation.</li>
        <li>Breakfast and snack times are the most common moments for unhealthy choices.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="ideation">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>From these insights, we asked:</p>
      <p><strong>💭 How might we make nutrition education a co-learning experience for families with young children?</strong></p>
      <p>I generated 15 initial ideas in response to this question — ranging from physical experiences to digital tools. Recognising that not all families have equal access to technology, I explored both directions but chose to prioritise physical concepts to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all families.</p>
