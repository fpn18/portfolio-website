      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Vita is a women’s health platform designed to create a safe, supportive space where women can share health challenges and connect with others who truly understand.</p>
      <p>For decades, medical research and digital health tools have primarily focused on men — leaving women misdiagnosed, misunderstood, or underrepresented. Vita aims to close that gap by combining community support with reliable, women-specific health information, empowering users to learn, advocate, and take control of their well-being.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Women’s health has long been overlooked in medical research and digital solutions.</p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>⚖️ Gender data gap</strong>: Most medical studies historically centered on men, leading to misdiagnoses for women.</li>
        <li><strong>💬 Lack of community</strong>: Women often lack safe, empathetic spaces to discuss sensitive health issues.</li>
        <li><strong>⚠️ Misinformation overload</strong>: Online platforms are full of unverified or biased content, making it difficult to know what’s trustworthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Vita addresses these issues by offering a safe, data-informed, and community-driven ecosystem built for women.</p>

    <section class="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To ensure Vita met real needs, we conducted user interviews, surveys, and competitive analyses.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>💡 Users wanted both credible information and emotional validation.</li>
        <li>💡 Privacy and empathy were top priorities in health-related sharing.</li>
        <li>💡 There was a clear need for personalized recommendations — content tailored to individual conditions and life stages.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="ideation">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>Using insights from research, our team explored way to combine trust, personalization, and connection. We mapped the user journey, identifying emotional pain points and designing flows that prioritize safety, clarity, and inclusivity.</p>
      <p><strong>Guiding Questions:</p></strong>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li>“How might we make women feel safe asking any question?”</li>
        <li>“How can we connect women with shared health experiences?”</li>
        <li>“How do we ensure all content feels trustworthy and human?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vita is a holistic, intelligent platform that empowers women through information, empathy, and connection.</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ul class="meta">
        <li><strong>🤖 AI Health Chatbot</strong>: An intelligent assistant that allows users to ask any health-related question and get responses based on verified, women-specific sources — offering support without judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>💬 Communities</strong>: Topic-based groups where users can join others with similar health experiences (e.g., PCOS, endometriosis, menopause, fertility) to share stories and advice.</li>
        <li><strong>🪶 Social Feed</strong>: A dynamic feed where users can post updates, share articles, and engage with others — fostering connection and openness in a safe environment.</li>
        <li><strong>🔒 Private Messaging</strong>: Direct, confidential messaging that enables deeper conversations and support between users.</li>
        <li><strong>📚 Learning Hub</strong>: A personalized content center curated by medical experts, adapting to user interests and health conditions — blending credibility with accessibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, these features create a trusted, empowering digital companion for women’s well-being.</p>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Designing Vita reinforced the power of empathy-led design in health tech. I learned that information alone isn’t enough — users need to feel seen, supported, and understood.</p>
      <p>This project strengthened my ability to design for trust, inclusivity, and sensitivity, showing how thoughtful UX can bridge the gap between data and human connection.</p>
